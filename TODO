Let the CA code to be a role
wanna-server and buildd roles will depend on it
using vars to classify the server and client

======================================================

CA private keys should not copy to host

sign it
copy to remote
- ansible seems has no way to execute shell locally
(seems local_action can do this)

done
======================================================

change wanna-server code  to be a role
